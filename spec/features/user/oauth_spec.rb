# As a user
# When I visit /dashboard
# Then I should see a link that is styled like a button that says "Connect to Github"
# And when I click on "Connect to Github"
# Then I should go through the OAuth process
# And I should be redirected to /dashboard
# And I should see all of the content from the previous Github stories (repos, followers, and following)
